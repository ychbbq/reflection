was introduced?

	quickly spot the difference between two versions, which usually is a bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: one commit per logical change
    cons: forgot to commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    some files are logically highly coupled together like HTML and CSS, thus one logical change may affect multiple files, and this is one commit. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To track every changes in each commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
